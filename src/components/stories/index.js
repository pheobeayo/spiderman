                            <br></br>business. To cut out the middleman and make
                            <br></br>art accessible directly from the artist to the fan,
                            <br></br> it is one of the beauties of the internet. And that's
                            <br></br>why I made it official that my Subscribers = my label.
                            <br></br>Thank you for believing in me and my music. 
                            <br></br>Thank you for supporting art.”

                            Subscribestar has one of the best supports I have 
                            <br></br>ever seen with a major company. They have always
                            <br></br> responded promptly to my requests, 
                            <br></br> helped me set up the payment and even went
                            <br></br>overboard to help me with an issue that
                            <br></br>I had with my payment provider. They 
                            <br></br>msged the payment provider tech support  
                            <br></br>(who was ignoring me) themselves and within a 
                            <br></br>couple of days the issue was solved.

                            SubscribeStar has been a great opportunity for me 
                            <br></br>to connect with my fans who value having
                            <br></br>a place to support my work without the 
                            <br></br>censorship bias. The tools are easy to use  
                            <br></br>and have helped me connect with my fans and 
                            <br></br>update them on my projects. I am so happy
